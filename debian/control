Description: utility to choose one option from a set of choices
 The pick utility allows users to choose one option from a set of
 choices using an interface with fuzzy search functionality.
 pick reads a list of choices on stdin and outputs the selected choice
 on stdout. Therefore it is easily used both in pipelines and subshells.
