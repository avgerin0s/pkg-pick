# Pick

![pick(1) usage](screencast.gif)

The `pick(1)` utility allows users to choose one option from a set of choices
using an interface with fuzzy search functionality.

## Installation

### Arch Linux

A package for Pick is available in [the AUR].

```sh
wget https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi/pick/pick.tar.gz
tar -xzf pick.tar.gz
cd pick
makepkg -s
pacman -U pick-VERSION-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
```

### Mac OS X via Homebrew

```sh
brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
brew install pick
```

### Mac OS X via MacPorts

```sh
sudo port install pick
```

### From source

1. Download the latest release from [the releases page], optionally check the
   signature and extract the archive:

```sh
wget https://github.com/thoughtbot/pick/releases/download/vVERSION/pick-VERSION.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/thoughtbot/pick/releases/download/vVERSION/pick-VERSION.tar.gz.asc
gpg --verify pick-VERSION.tar.gz.asc
tar -xzf pick-VERSION.tar.gz
```

2. Follow the bundled installation instructions:

```sh
cd pick-VERSION
less INSTALL.md
```

## Usage

`pick(1)` reads a list of choices on `stdin` and outputs the selected choice on
`stdout`. Therefore it is easily used both in pipelines and subshells:

```sh
git ls-files | pick | xargs less # Select a file in the current git repository to view in less
cd $(find . -type d | pick)      # Select a directory to cd into
```

Pick can also easily be used from within Vim both using `system()` and `!`. For
ready-to-map functions, see [the pick.vim Vim plugin]. For examples of how to
call `pick(1)` from within Vim, see [the pick.vim source code].

***Please note:*** pick requires a fully functional terminal to run and
therefore cannot be run from within gvim or MacVim.

See the `pick(1)` man page for detailed usage instructions and more examples.
